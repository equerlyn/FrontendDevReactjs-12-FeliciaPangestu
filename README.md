This project is a restaurant listing and review application with a frontend and backend component. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.
## Folder Structure
- `restaurant-back-end`: Contains the backend code for the project.
- `restaurant-project`: Contains the frontend code for the project.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v18.4.0)
- Reactjs (v18.2.0 or higher)

## How to Start Project
### Backend Setup
To set up and run the backend server:
1. Navigate to the backend directory (do this step IF YOUR DIRECTORY ENDS WITH FrontendDevReactjs-12-FeliciaPangestu):
```cd restaurant-back-end```
2. Install the dependencies:
```npm i```
3. Start the backend server:
```npm run start```
The backend server should now be running and accessible.

### Frontend Setup
To set up and run the frontend application:
1. Navigate to the frontend directory (do this step IF YOUR DIRECTORY ENDS WITH FrontendDevReactjs-12-FeliciaPangestu):
```cd restaurant-project```
2. Install the dependencies:
```npm i```
3. Start the frontend development server:
```npm run dev```
The frontend application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:3000 .

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that both the backend and frontend servers are running for the application to function correctly.
- Create a .env file in both the backend and frontend directories and update it with the required environment variables, such as API keys (refer to ```.env.example```)

#### Personal Notes
1. I chose not to host the project online due to privacy concerns regarding uploading personal identification documents (KTP).
2. The implementation of the filter dropdown feature was not completed due to time constraints imposed by my university courseworküò≠üôèüèª.
3. Efforts to display maps in the detail view were unsuccessful due to unclear documentation and insufficient resources.
4. The inability to retrieve restaurant categories (such as "Thai", "Japanese", "Steak") is attributed to limitations in the API, as discussed in this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16023571/google-places-api-restaurant-types)
5. Total estimated time spent on the project is approximately 30 hours (1 Day 6 Hours).
